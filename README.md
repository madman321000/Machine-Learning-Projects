This repository is various Machine Learning Projects using starter code from the ud120 github repo.

In the naive_bayes folder, the nb_author_id.py progam trains a Naieve Bayes classifier from data to be able to predict whether a text sample is from Chris or Sara. Then after the classifier was trained it was tested agianst a new data set and it had a 97.3% accuracy rate.

In the svm folder, the svm_author_id.py program trains an SVM classifier with a linear kernel and C=10000 from them same data that the naive_bayes classifier was trained. The accuracy of the SVM classifier was 99.1%.
