This repository is various Machine Learning Projects using starter code from the ud120 github repo.

In the naive_bayes folder, the nb_author_id.py progam trains a Naieve Bayes classifier from data to be able to predict whether a text sample is from Chris or Sara. Then after the classifier was trained it was tested agianst a new data set and it had a 97.3% accuracy rate.

In the svm folder, the svm_author_id.py program trains an SVM classifier with a linear kernel and C=10000 from them same data that the naive_bayes classifier was trained. The accuracy of the SVM classifier was 99.1%.

In the decision tree folder, the dt_author_id.py program trains an Decision Tree classifier with a linear kernel and C=10000 from them same data that the naive_bayes classifier was trained. The accuracy of the Decision Tree classifier was 97.8%.

In the choose_your_own folder, the your_algorithm.py program trains a Random Forest classifier with terrain data to classify it and the algorithm was tested with a different set of data. The accuracy was 92.8%
